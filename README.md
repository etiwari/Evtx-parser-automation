# Evtx-parser-automation
This is a small bash script that lets you automated the file-byfile parsing done by Evtx parser written by Andreas Schuster.
All you need to do is once you have downloaded the Evtx-parser by Andreas Schuster (https://www.vanimpe.eu/2015/07/16/use-evtxparser-convert-windows-event-log-files-xml/), in the Parse-Evtx-x.x.x/scripts directory, add the evtx_to_xml.sh script and run it. Then when prompted for the log file location and the dump location, privide them and you are all set.
